# An initiative tracker for combat

A game master usually tracks the initiative during the combat phase on a piece of paper. I wanted to make this experience easier and also provide some information regarding any conditions those characters might have. Currently the initiative tracker handles rules for the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons and the 7th edition of Call of Cthulu
